For last 15 years, my school, Ryan Int'l Ghaziabad, was using a ballot box based voting system, so my Computer Science faculty asked me for a solution. Hence I made the first ever electronic voting system for my school. 

The CUI version was used continuously for 2 years and later on another branch of the school showed their interest in the software.
